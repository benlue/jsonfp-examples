jsonfp-examples
===============

This will be a repository of sample codes and examples to help developers getting familiar with JSON-FP.

All examples are located in the [example](https://github.com/benlue/jsonfp-examples/tree/master/examples) directory.

Below is a briefing:

+ [Simple](https://github.com/benlue/jsonfp-examples/blob/master/examples/simple/simple.js) : tries some simple things to get yourself familiar with JSON-FP.

+ [Object Query](https://github.com/benlue/jsonfp-examples/blob/master/examples/ObjectQuery) : shows how to use JSON-FP to query objects.

+ [Iteration](https://github.com/benlue/jsonfp-examples/tree/master/examples/stream) : It's quite common to do repetitive tasks in a program. In imperative programming languages, you usually use the for-loop or while-loop statement to do iteration. In JSON-FP, you can use a much more elegant feature, the iterator stream, to achieve that.

+ [Baseball Pitchers](https://github.com/benlue/jsonfp-examples/blob/master/examples/bbPitcher/README.md) : finds the average ERA and salary of MLB pitchers, and which pitchers have better ERA and lower salary than the average.

+ [Metaprogramming](https://github.com/benlue/jsonfp-examples/blob/master/examples/metapro/README.md) : This example uses formula and variable substitution to make the ["Baseball Pitchers"](https://github.com/benlue/jsonfp-examples/blob/master/examples/bbPitcher/BaseballPitchers.js) example shorter and easier to read.

## Required version
To run all of the above examples, the [latest JSON-FP runtime](http://npmjs.com/package/jsonfp) (v0.2.1) is required.
